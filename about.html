                <p>

                    A frontend Engineer with experience in using React javascrip, and tailwind css to
                    deliver unique and responsive website designs, with full capability of transforming
                    figma designs into fully responsive websites.

                    A few things about me include my love for cars and books. <br>
                    Reading is a very interesting endeavour, it makes me experience living
                    a different life and exciting adventures. Although fictional, it is quite
                    engaging and very educative, it opens my mind to a vast option of imagination.
                    I also love the concepts of poems, unlike essays poems convey emotions.
                    Each word, each line and each rhyme conveys emotions deep enough to enchant
                    the reader.
                    <br>
                    Cars on the other hand is more than just love, it's more of an obsession,
                    especially when German Machines are in question.
                    <br>
                    Unlike the above, My passion for Web development is more than a fantasical
                    dream, it's a goal, a career, and my future.

                    like all obstacles that came before it, i hope you've still got the drive to improve regardless of all odds. I hope you're doing 
                    better, living happier and working hard.

                    This is an invaluable opportunity for me to prove what i can do, i hope the mentors can overlook my errors whenever i make them and 
                    show mercy in their judging. I hope i am able to pass this stage and the rest to come. Shout out to the HNG team for providing this 
                    opportunity, I truly appreciate it.
